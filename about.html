                                In the late 90s Mark started his higher education at a community college in Marbletown, NY. Starting first with Computer Science and quickly pivoting to Graphic Arts and Advertising, Mark graduated in 2003 with an Associates Degree. Having a long love of Music, and being the son of a teacher, Mark then decided to pursue Music Education at a small private school in Searcy, AR. Mark didn't really like being so far away from New York, and transferred to SUNY Fredonia after just a year in the south.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mark graduated with a BME in 2007, and started his teaching career in the Churchville-Chili Central School District. After a year teaching elementary general music and chorus, he got a new job at Monroe High School in the Rochester City School district. Two years in, the country experienced an economic depression and teachers all over the country, especially those in non-core subjects, were laid off. Mark was not spared.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Not wanting to give up Music, Mark pursued a graduate degree from the University at Buffalo where, in 2013, he recieved a Master's degree in Education. Sadly, this did little to affect his job prospects, and after numerous job interviews concluded that teaching in public education was not the path for him.

                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--8-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <p>
                                In late 2012, Mark found an opportunty to partner with Google as a Trusted Photographer for Rochester, NY. Mark began to take panoramic imagery of businesses in the area and upload them to Street View. Starting first with a DBA that he ran himself, he soon partnered with a company based in Toronto, Canada to bring the service to businesses throughout all of New York.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mark found it difficult to deal with the personal goals he had for Rochester and the larger expansion plans that the Canadian company had, and so in May of 2015, he split and formed a new business to serve the Western NY area: Be Local Now. Since mid 2015, Mark has continued to provide the Street View photography service to businesses throughout the area.

                                Beginning from a very early age, Mark has had a great love for programming. His early college experience soured him to the idea of what seemed like a very tedious and thankless job and caused him to pursue other things after that. Throughout the past five years, Mark has had opportunities to get his hands wet, so-to-speak, on a variety of web development projects ranging from simple API calls in Google Sheets, to a project where an outside developer was hired.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With each new challenge and problem to be solved with programming, Mark felt the pull of his first love. In early 2016, Mark enrolled in the TechDegree program at Treehouse. The program was exactly what Mark needed to succeed: self-paced learning, peer reviews, a community, and--most of all--an opportunity to immerse himself in something that had once been such a huge part of his life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mark now works full time as a Front End Web Developer, building websites and single-page applications for friends, family, businesses, and himself.
